  <h1>Welcome<small> to <i>4Risk Manager</i></small></h1>
  For requirements engineers could work with security requirements in a system and do a check list with cataloging these, we propose the <strong>4Risk Mananger</strong>, a risk manager, which provides an interface to aid creation of security requirements. This system makes possible cataloging threats in projects, and also ways to mitigate them, and aims to assist the engineer, through this knowledge, to elucidate the risks inherent to the project.
